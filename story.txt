The alarm rang, waking Timmy suddenly. It was time for school. He got dressed and ran downstairs where his mother had breakfast ready for him. He ate his 
breakfast as quickly as possible, because the school bus was coming soon. As he finished his last bite, he saw the school bus coming down the street. He
grabbed his school bag and headed for the corner, where the bus stopped every morning. He got up on the bus and as he was walking down the aisle someone
tripped him. As Timmy got up, he say Big Willis standing over him.

Big Willis was the school bully, Timmy's dad was Big Willis's dads partner for 15 years as cops. However Timmy's dad never returned from a mission one time and Big Willis's dad was the one person there. As Timmy got up from the trip he pushed Willis to the side and ran off the bus. He started to walk to the place his dad went missing. As soon as he reached there he saw a box.
